# Where did the hospitals go? A Californian case study

How are hospitals in California distributed, and are they serving every place equally? With open data from the state government, we can attempt answering these questions ourselves, with GIS graphics to boot.

See rendered notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/openerror/SpatialCAHospitals/blob/master/CAHospitalAvail.ipynb). Unpack `data.zip` in the same folder as `CAHospitalAvail.ipynb` to reproduce results.

Everest Law came up with the idea of comparing population and hospital densities; he then coded up the entire analysis.

Everest Law was made aware of the data on non-federal, Californian hospitals through discussions with Chelsea Lee. It was also Chelsea Lee who initially suggested studying the spatial distribution of hospitals, in order to uncover underserved communities.
