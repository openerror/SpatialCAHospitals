# Where did the hospitals go? A Californian case study

How are hospitals in California distributed, and are they serving every place equally? With open data from the state government, we can attempt answering these questions ourselves, with GIS graphics to boot.

See rendered notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/openerror/SpatialCAHospitals/blob/master/CAHospitalAvail.ipynb). Unpack `data.zip` in the same folder as `CAHospitalAvail.ipynb` to reproduce results.

Everest Law first discovered shapefiles of Californian geographical boundaries from
[](data.ca.gov). While seeking a research direction, he self-taught the tools and concepts necessary for making use of such geospatial data. Once a direction was identified, Everest Law defined the metric (population VS hospital densities), and
then coded up the entire analysis.

Everest Law was made aware of the data on non-federal, Californian hospitals through discussions with Chelsea Lee. It was also Chelsea Lee who initially suggested studying the spatial distribution of hospitals, in order to uncover underserved communities. Much thanks!
